# tests

Directory containing test cases. 
The following test can be found in the directory: 
- [**One layer, spherically-symmetric**](Test_One_Layer_Spherically_Symmetric.mlx): Compares LOV3D Love numbers against love numbers obtained analytically for a uniform spherically-symmetric bode
- [**Enceladus with lateral variations**](Test_Enceladus_Two_Layer_Lateral_Variations.mlx): 3 layer Enceladus model consisting of a rigid core, ocean and ice-shell with lateral variations. Compares LOV3D Love numbers against love numbers obtained using the perturbation method of [Qin et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggu279) and the FEM model of (Berne et al.)[https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL106656]. Reproduces Figure 2 of [Rovira et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.15710)
